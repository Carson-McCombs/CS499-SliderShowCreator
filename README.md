## Part 1: Creating a Slideshow

### I.	Creating a new slideshow file

To create a new slideshow file, navigate your cursor to the “New” button at the top left of the application and left click on that button. A window will pop up with a prompt to enter the name of the slideshow. Type in the name of the slideshow into the white box and click the “OK” button on the right side of the window. This will create a new slideshow file with the name you typed in that you can begin to edit.

### II.	Importing a directory of images

When creating a slideshow, one is able to import a directory of images, from which individual images can be placed in the slideshow. In order to import a directory of images, follow the following steps:

1.	On the top left of the main screen of the application, find the manilla folder-shaped icon
2.	Click on the manilla folder icon to open a small window that allows you to browse your system folders.
3.	In that window, navigate to the folder containing the images you want.
5.	Click on that folder once to highlight it in blue, then click the “OK” button.
   
When this is done, all of the images in that folder will appear in the left-hand panel of the application and are able to be placed into the slideshow.

### III.	Placing images in a slideshow

To place an image in the slideshow:

1.	Find the image you want to add from the left-hand panel.
2.	Hover your cursor over the image so that the image is highlighted with blue borders.
3.	Left click once on the image to add it to the slideshow.

After the first image is added to the slideshow, whenever a new image is added to the slideshow, a transition is automatically added between the image being added and the previous image.

### IV.	Importing audio files

To import an audio file into the slideshow, navigate your cursor to the “Add” button in the right panel of the application window and left click on that button. This will open a window where you can navigate to the audio file you want to add (must be a .mp3, .wav, or .aiff file). Select the file you want to add, then click the “OK” button in the bottom right of that window. This will import the audio file and add it to the slideshow.

### V.	Selecting presentation mode

When making a slideshow, you can select between two presentation modes:

1.	Manual: This setting makes it so that the slideshow is only advanced via the left and right arrows in the presentation controls.
2.	Automatic: This setting makes the slideshow advance to the next slide automatically after an amount of time that you set per slide.
 
To select the presentation mode, navigate your cursor to the dropdown box to the right of the Close button and left click on it to show the two options. Left click on the option that you want, and the slideshow will be changed to be in that mode.

If you have selected the Automatic presentation mode, you can change the amount of time between slides by first finding the slide whose advance time you want to edit in the slide track and left click on the image. This will open a window where you can change the amount of time for that slide. There is a text box with the label “Duration” where you can enter in the number of seconds for that slide.

### VI.	Setting transitions between slides

Between each image of the slideshow, there will be one of five different transitions:

1.	Wipe left
2.	Wipe right
3.	Wipe up
4.	Wipe down
5.	Cross fade
6.	Blank

To select between the different transitions, first add the images you would like to the slideshow. Then:

1.	Find the transition on the slide track that you would like to change
2.	Hover your cursor over the transition element so that it is highlighted in blue
3.	Left click on the highlighted transition to cycle through the different transitions until the desired one is reached

### VII.	Saving slideshow file

To save the slideshow, navigate your cursor to the “Save” button at the top left of the application window and left click on that button. That will save your slideshow into a folder called “Slideshow Save File” in the same directory that the application is in.

## Part 2: Presenting a Slideshow

### I.	Opening a saved presentation

To open a saved presentation, navigate your cursor to the “Open” button at the top left of the application window and left click that button. A window will pop up where you can navigate to the folder that has the name of your slideshow. Select that folder and hit the “OK” button at the lower right of that window. This will open that slideshow in the editor window, and you can proceed to either edit the slideshow or present.

### II.	Starting a presentation

To start a finished slideshow:

1.	Have the slideshow opened in the main editor window
2.	Navigate your cursor to the top-right of the window and find the button labelled “Present”
3.	Left click the “Present” button

When the “Present” button is clicked, a new window will appear with the current open slideshow.

###  III.	Presentation controls

There are some presentation controls at the disposal of the user when presenting the slideshow. When hovering over the bottom-center of the slideshow window, left and right arrows will appear that the user can click on to change to the previous and next slides, respectively. To exit out of the presentation, the user can click the “X” button on the top right of the presentation window to close the presentation window.
